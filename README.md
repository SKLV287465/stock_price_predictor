# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis
## Markov Chain
Implemented a first order markov chain with 6 states, which yielded a ~50.5% success rate in guessing the direction of the stock pricefor the next day.
## FFT algorithm
Utilised the python FFT library to create a tool that created a fit for a user inputted stock code.
## Arima model
Utilised the python arima library to create a tool that predicts a user inputted stock code.
## Trading bot
Created a trading bot which outputs a graph that depicts the amount of profit/loss that would theoretically be made if our algorithm was used to trade through buy/sell binary decisions each day.
